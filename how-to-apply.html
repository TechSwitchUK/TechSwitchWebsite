          <p>
            As part of the application form we will ask you to include a cover
            letter and CV.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your CV should give us a general idea of your background and
            previous experience as well as if you have had any experience with
            coding yourself e.g. an online course, following free tutorials or
            other bootcamps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your cover letter should include a little about yourself, your
            background and your motivation for retraining as a Software
            Developer.

        <h2>Online Tests</h2>

        <div class="medium-width-text">
          <p>
            The next stage of the application process is to take a series of
            online tests. You will be able to take these at any time and in any
            order.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the online tests will involve writing some code of your own
            in JavaScript. If you have never written any JavaScript or code
            before, don't worry as we provide pre-reading to teach you some
            basic JavaScript and help you prepare for this coding test. We
            generally recommend applicants to select Level 1 unless you have
            substantial prior coding experience. There is a practice test that
            you can complete before taking the actual test. The test is split
            into three questions and you must finish each one before moving on
            to the next. There is a total of four hours to complete all three
            questions (this does not include the practice test.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The other two online tests do not require any coding and are logic
            puzzles. You do not need to have completed the JavaScript
            pre-reading in order to take these.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have completed all of the online tests we aim to let you
            know if you have progressed to the interview stage within 1 working
            day.
          </p>

          <p>The final stage of the application process is the interview.</p>
          <p>
            This will be split into two sections. One will be a coding challenge
            which our trainer will help guide you through and the other is a
            more general chat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interview will generally take no more than 2 hours total and we
            use an informal format so feel free to dress casually.
