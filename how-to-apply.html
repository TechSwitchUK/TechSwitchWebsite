                <p>As part of the application form we will ask you to include a cover letter and CV.</p>
                <p>Your CV should give us a general idea of your background and previous experience as well as if you
                    have had any experience with coding yourself e.g. an online course, following free tutorials or
                    other bootcamps.</p>
                <p>Your cover letter should include a little about yourself, your background and your motivation for
                    retraining as a Software Developer.</p>

            <h2>Online Tests</h2>

            <div class="medium-width-text">
                <p>The next stage of the application process is to take a series of online tests. You will be able to
                    take
                    these at any time and in any order.
                <p>One of the online tests will involve writing some code of your own in JavaScript. If you have never
                    written any JavaScript or code before, don't worry as we provide pre-reading to teach you some basic
                    JavaScript and help you prepare for this coding test. We generally recommend applicants to select
                    Level 1 unless you have substantial prior coding experience. There is a practice test that you can
                    complete before taking the actual test. The test is split into three questions and you must finish
                    each one before moving on to the next. There is a total of four hours to complete all three
                    questions (this does not include the practice test.)</p>
                <p>The other two online tests do not require any coding and are logic puzzles. You do not need to have
                    completed the JavaScript pre-reading in order to take these.</p>
                <p>Once you have completed all of the online tests we aim to let you know if you have progressed to the
                    interview stage within 1 working day.</p>

                <p>The final stage of the application process is the interview.</p>
                <p>This will be split into two sections. One will be a coding challenge which our trainer will help
                    guide you through and the other is a more general chat.</p>
                <p>The interview will generally take no more than 2 hours total and we use an informal format so feel
                    free to
                    dress casually.</p>
