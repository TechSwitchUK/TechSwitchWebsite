At <span class="yellow">TechSwitch</span>, our mission is to provide people from all walks of life with the opportunity to become Software Developers, regardless of their background. And our <span class="yellow">Application Process</span> has been designed with this in mind.

We place strong importance on diversity and recruit individuals based on their potential rather than solely on experience. <span class="yellow">Aptitude</span>, <span class="yellow">Attitude</span> and <span class="yellow">Motivation</span> are the three key attributes that we look out for throughout the Application Process.

## 1. Application Form
In the initial <a href="/application-form" class="yellow">application form</a>, we ask you to include a Cover Letter in addition to a CV. The Cover Letter is a great opportunity for you to share a bit more about yourself, your background and most importantly, your <span class="yellow">motivation</span> for retraining as a Software Developer. 

It gives you the chance to also outline any steps that you may have taken in your coding journey so far, e.g. online courses, free tutorials, bootcamps, meetups, etc.

## 2. Online Tests
The second stage of the application process is a series of online tests – three in total.
Two of these tests are logic puzzles, and the third test will involve writing some code of your own in JavaScript. If you have never written any JavaScript or code before, don't panic! We will provide you with pre-reading material to teach you some of the basics and help you to prepare for the coding test. What we are looking to identify at this stage is <span class="yellow">aptitude</span> and also <span class="yellow">attitude</span> – willingness and the ability to learn.

## 3. Interview Stage
The final stage of the application process is the interview session which is split into two parts. The first part will be a coding challenge with one of our trainers and they will help guide you through it. The second part is more of a general chat – we use a strength-based approach because rather than fixate on your career history, we want to gain an insight into what you enjoy (and don’t enjoy) doing. The interview stage is an opportunity for you to let your personality shine through so feel free to draw on experiences from all aspects of life. Be authentic, we want to get to know you and what makes you tick.
