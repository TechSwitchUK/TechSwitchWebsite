          <p>
            When you access our website it uses cookies to record the basic
            information provided by your web browser. This information is purely
            technical and does not contain any personal details. We also make
            use of third party analytics cookies to provide anonymised
            information on website usage. We use this data to assist with
            problems that may arise in relation to this website and to aggregate
            access trends to provide a better browsing experience. In addition,
            we use third party analytics to identify key business individuals
            who may benefit from hearing about our services. When we contact
            business individuals about our services, we allow them to opt out of
            receiving future marketing communications from us.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can contact us directly or you can register your contact details
            with us and when you do so:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              you consent to us contacting you using the details you have
              provided so that we can respond to your request;
            </li>
            <li>
              personal information that you share with us will only be used for
              the purposes for which you have provided it;
            </li>
            <li>
              we protect the security of the personal information you provide
              against unauthorised access and misuse using appropriate technical
              and operational measures;
            </li>
            <li>
              we do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with

            </li>
            <li>
              we hold your personal information on our systems only for as long
              as necessary for the relevant activity or as required by law.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you are under the age of 16, please get the permission of your
            parent or guardian before sending any of your personal information
            to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you apply to attend a TechSwitch training course, we collect
            personal information directly from you in order to assess your
            application and to enrol you on a course if your application is
            successful. Examples of information we may collect are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>your name, address and contact details</li>
            <li>
              your education, training and professional development history
            </li>
            <li>information recorded during skills tests and interviews</li>
            <li>
              information you have made publicly available about yourself on
              social media networks and databases
            </li>
            <li>your billing, transaction and payment card information</li>
            <li>photographic ID</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As part of the assessment, we may also collect your personal
            information from third parties such as recruitment agencies,
            colleagues who recommend you, individuals or companies you have
            previously worked for and agencies performing security screening
            checks to facilitate your placement on assignments following
            successful completion of a course.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a candidate for or a participant on a course, we may ask you for
            diversity information (e.g. gender, nationality, ethnicity) and if
            you agree to provide this, it will be used only for internal
            statistical purposes to help us to promote diversity and equality at
            TechSwitch. We may also, if necessary, record special (more
            sensitive) categories of information (e.g. information about your
            physical or mental health) in order to make reasonable adjustments
            to facilitate your application for and attendance on a course and to
            ensure that we comply with laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a course participant, we will record information about your
            attendance and progress on the course. We may ask you to respond to
            surveys to collect feedback which we will use as guidance for
            improvements to the course. We may also ask for your consent to
            film, photograph or record you as part of the creation of content to
            promote the course.
          </p>

          <h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>

          <p>
            We share your personal information within TechSwitch to a limited
            extent with individuals who need the information to perform their
            role in providing courses, such as course tutors and those who
            manage invoicing. When dealing with your application for a course,
            we may also share your personal information with third parties such
            as academic institutions (to verify qualifications), individuals and
            companies providing references and companies providing services such
            as security screening checks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under limited circumstances, your personal data may be transferred
            to countries outside the EEA, for example by third party service
            providers delivering centralised support for their IT platform from
            the US. In such cases, we ensure that the transfer complies with the
            relevant data protection legislation.
          </p>

            consent to do so if this is our legal basis for processing such
            data.

            inaccurate or out of date. If we have a legitimate reason not to
            fulfil your request, we will communicate this to you. If you believe
            that we have not complied with your data protection rights, you can
            complain to the Information Commissioner.
