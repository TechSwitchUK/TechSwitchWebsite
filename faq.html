          <h3>General Questions</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>Are there any necessary qualifications?</h4>
            <p>
              No! If you have done some hobby coding in your spare time that
              might help you find your feet quicker but it definitely isn't
              necessary.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>How long is the course?</h4>
            <p>
              The course consists of 12 weeks of training, followed by an
              18-month job placement in industry with the option of making that
              a permanent role.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Do you need any previous coding experience?</h4>
            <p>
              No! No previous experience is required. We will provide all the
              training you need to become a confident software developer.
              However, upon application we will provide you with pre-reading
              which will enable you to take the technical tests we set. Please
              give yourself time to study this before taking the tests.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>
              I'm currently studying, can I take this bootcamp at the same time?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the course and placement are both full-time so you
              would be unable to study alongside taking our bootcamp and working
              during the placement.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Course Details</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>What are the hours and where is it?</h4>
            <p>
              Teaching hours are 10am-4pm from Mon-Fri. The initial 12-week
              bootcamp is ordinarily based in our offices in north London, but
              currently will be held remotely to ensure the safety of our staff
              and learners.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What languages/technology do you teach?</h4>
            <p>
              The course focuses on Fullstack Development. So we start with
              JavaScript and lead into further web development (React,
              Typescript, HTML, CSS) and then bring in C#/.NET as the backend
              technology.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>How much is the course?</h4>
            <p>
              Free! We want learners with potential to be great software
              developers, not just those who can pay a large course fee.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is the course structure?</h4>
            <p>
              The first three weeks will be spent on a bootcamp going through a
              series of exercises which increase in difficulty as you go along.
              We then introduce more general web development and finish this up
              with a group project. After this we introduce backend/server side
              technology and work through a number of exercises around this. For
              the final three weeks you will complete a group project.
              Throughout the course there will also be training in Agile
              practices, soft skills and interview techniques.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What size are the cohorts?</h4>
            <p>
              Cohorts range in size between 5-10 learners. We keep them small to
              make sure you get enough one-to-one time with the trainer.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Placements</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>Do I get a say in where my placement is?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes! We won't force you to take a placement you don't want but
              this is also why we can't guarantee that we find you a job as it
              is up to you to interview at for the placement and accept the
              role.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Will I be paid a salary?</h4>
            <p>
              Not during the 12 week training, but once you have successfully
              completed that we will pay you a Â£30,000 salary.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Will the placement be based in London?</h4>
            <p>
              The vast majority of our placements are based in London but on the
              off-chance they are based elsewhere we will offer a relocation
              package.
