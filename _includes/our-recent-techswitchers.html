        I came in to this course with almost no prior knowledge of programming
        and through it secured a full-time developer role. Whilst the course is
        fast-paced and challenging, Techswitch does a great job of ensuring you
        feel truly valued and supported throughout by offering great teaching,
        frequent one-on-one chats and, if you need it, extra mentoring and tasks
        to make sure you nail those core concepts. The course has undoubtedly
        fast-tracked my career, and with the added safety net of expert tuition,
        top-end technology and even mock interviewing, I would highly recommend
        Techswitch to anyone looking to get in to software development.

        The Techswitch course has been such a great experience for me
        personally. While coding was what drew me to software development, the
        Techswitch course develops you to be a good software engineer. Of
        course, thereâ€™s a lot of coding involved as well! But less common
        topics, that are brushed off in online tutorials, are given equal (and
        sometimes more) importance. Things like learning git, the importance of
        testing, and working in an agile way have definitely given me a true
        understanding of what it means to be a real software engineer. On top of
        that, the actual course itself is really fun which makes coming in
        everyday so motivating and gets you genuinely excited to start a career
        in software development.

        Joining TechSwitch has transformed my career path. Although I had
        previously been self-studying code, I knew I needed industry-standard
        experience to navigate my way successfully into tech. TechSwitch
        provided a wide breadth of project-based learning in software
        development, along with both coding and career mentorship. The holistic
        approach to my growth meant that I felt supported every step of the way.
        Best of all, I came out even more enthusiastic about being a developer
        than when I started!
