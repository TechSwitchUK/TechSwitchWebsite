                I came in to this course with almost no prior knowledge of programming and through it secured a
                full-time
                developer role. Whilst the course is fast-paced and challenging, Techswitch does a great job of ensuring
                you
                feel truly valued and supported throughout by offering great teaching, frequent one-on-one chats and, if
                you
                need it, extra mentoring and tasks to make sure you nail those core concepts. The course has undoubtedly
                fast-tracked my career, and with the added safety net of expert tuition, top-end technology and even
                mock
                interviewing, I would highly recommend Techswitch to anyone looking to get in to software development.

                The Techswitch course has been such a great experience for me personally. While coding was what drew me
                to
                software development, the Techswitch course develops you to be a good software engineer. Of course,
                there’s
                a lot of coding involved as well! But less common topics, that are brushed off in online tutorials, are
                given equal (and sometimes more) importance. Things like learning git, the importance of testing, and
                working in an agile way have definitely given me a true understanding of what it means to be a real
                software
                engineer. On top of that, the actual course itself is really fun which makes coming in everyday so
                motivating and gets you genuinely excited to start a career in software development.

                Joining TechSwitch has transformed my career path. Although I had previously been self-studying code, I
                knew
                I needed industry-standard experience to navigate my way successfully into tech. TechSwitch provided a
                wide
                breadth of project-based learning in software development, along with both coding and career mentorship.
                The
                holistic approach to my growth meant that I felt supported every step of the way. Best of all, I came
                out
                even more enthusiastic about being a developer than when I started!
